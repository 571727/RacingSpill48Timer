## racingmaybe.jar_A_Multiplayer_Stategy_Racing_Game
This project is a game where you can race online with your friends or against AI and strategize your next step per turn or race if you will.
The game requires you to think thoroughly and react quickly at different stages.

## Motivation
My motivation behind making this game was to have another game to play with my friends. We usually play strategy games,
but I really like racing games. I could not find a game that satisfied both areas, so here we are. Also this is free.
